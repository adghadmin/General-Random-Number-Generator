# General-Random-Number-Generator
This project is a design&implementation of a General Random Number Generator using the mrg algorithm, for more details regarding this algorithm, please see: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/rng.html#c.gsl_rng_mrg.  
  
  RNG.zip provides the Vivado project writing in Verilog. My Vivado version is 2017.04.  
    
  The individual files of the Vivado project **noise_LCG** have been added to the repository.  
  
  diagram.pdf shows a brief description of the design.  
  
  Configuration of IP core.docx gives the configuration of the IP core used in the project.  
    
  The MATLAB script for validating the design has been included within the subdirectory **verif** . The MATLAB file **main.m** is used to compare the data generated by FPGA & MATLAB. **main.m** will load the **txt** file of the location of the simulation file. This location has been automatically written in the corresponding **txt** file by some instructions newly added to the file in **noise_LCG.srcs/sim_1/new/tb_LCG_gen.v** .
  
  The top level HDL file for the block and the code I wrote were in the location: **noise_LCG.srcs/sources_1/new** .
